# LISA Binaries
This repository provides simulated populations of **Galactic compact binaries** generated with **COSMIC**, used in [Paper Name].

## Key Features
- Populations correspond to specific **common envelope (CE) efficiency, α** values.  
- Only binaries with **gravitational wave frequencies > 40 μHz** are included.  
- **Supernova kicks** have been fully evolved.  
- Each dataset represents roughly **10% of a realistic Galactic population**.

These simulations are ideal for studying compact binary evolution, gravitational wave sources, and related astrophysical phenomena.
